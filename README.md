# Automated Input Console (AIC)

This program allows you to send ***automated input*** to an executable program

It a simple program written in **Python** which allows you to send automated input to an executable program (.Exe).

This program is tagretted specially for programmers. I noticed that it is very irritating to input same
data in a program after during program development. This program does that hard work for you.

It read data input from a text file and send them to target program. When that program is executed using AIC, the data is
automatically inputted to the program.

## Getting Started

It is really simple working with this simple project, just execute AIC.py and enter text filename that contains data to be inputted in the program, and then enter executable (.EXE) filename to execute and send input automatically.
Choose execute program option to execute program. Executing program through **AIC** wil send all input from given text file.
