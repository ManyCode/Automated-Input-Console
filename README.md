# Automated-Input-Console-AIC-
This program allows you to send ***automated input*** to an executable program

It a simple program written in **Python** which allows you to send automated input to an executable program (.Exe).

This program is tagretted specially for programmers. I noticed that it is very irritating to input same
data in a program after during program development. This program does that hard work for you.

It read data input from a text file and send them to target program. When that program is executed using AIC, the data is
automatically inputted to the program.
