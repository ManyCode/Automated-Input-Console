# Automated Input Console (AIC)

This program allows you to send ***automated input*** to an executable program

It a simple program written in **Python** which allows you to send automated input to an executable program (.Exe).

This program is tagretted specially for programmers. I noticed that it is very irritating to input same
data in a program after during program development. This program does that hard work for you.

It read data input from a text file and send them to target program. When that program is executed using AIC, the data is
automatically inputted to the program.

## Getting Started

It is really simple working with this simple project, just execute AIC.py and enter text filename that contains data to be inputted in the program, and then enter executable (.EXE) filename to execute and send input automatically.
Choose execute program option to execute program. Executing program through **AIC** wil send all input from given text file.

### Prerequisites

You must install Python first on your system.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
